          certifications in programming. I excel in fast-paced, mission-driven

          This portfolio is powered by NextJS where I demonstrate the use of
          custom components, React hooks, Dynamic routing with Next, pure CSS,
          vanilla JS, and HTML to showcase foundational skills in Frontend
          development. I've chosen NextJS to build this portfolio to leverage
          its server-side rendering for rapid page loads and SEO optimization.

          I've created a responsive webpage that uses advanced CSS techniques
          while employing best software architecture and design practices. Under
          the hood, I've extensively used functional and object-oriented
          programming to create dynamically-rendered components that minimizes
          repetitive code.
